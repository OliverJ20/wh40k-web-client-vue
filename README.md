# Wh40k-web-client-vue
# Prerequisites

1. `node installed` - If node is not installed please download from here https://nodejs.org/en/download/

This is the frontend component to a backend service which I have yet to seemlessly connect into one repo, please reference 
```
https://github.com/OliverJ20/Wh40k-List-Builder-Web
```
This is the repo for the backend component.

## Project setup

1. Run `yarn install` / `npm install`
2. Run `yarn serve`

This should spin up the node server and allow you to access the frontend application.

# Notes 

As Stated above this is meant to be joined with the backend web component and relies upon it for database interaction, 
the frontend will not function as intend without it.
